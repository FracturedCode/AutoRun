# AutoRun Alternative

This is a fork of Emonadeo's [AutoRun](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autorun-fabric). I made it because I wanted to have two sprint keys, one on my keyboard and one on my mouse. This happens to be especially useful while autorunning and doing something else and the sprint happens to cancel. Also I've gotten way too used to being able to double up keybinds in other games.

## Installation

> **Important:** This mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) like most other Fabric mods.

Download the JAR and place it into your .minecraft/mods folder. If it doesn't exist create it.

If you are using multiple Fabric mods I recommend also getting [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to keep an overview over all installed mods.

> **Note:** This mod is client-side only, meaning it does not have to be installed on the server.

## Usage

Press 'P' to toggle automatic walking. You can also hit the sprint key to sprint while auto-walking.

Press 'Mouse 5' for an alternate sprint key.

These keybinds can be customized in the controls options.
