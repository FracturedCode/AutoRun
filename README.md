# Auto Run

## Installation

> **Important:** This mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) like most other Fabric mods.

Download the JAR and place it into your .minecraft/mods folder. If it doesn't exist create it.

If you are using multiple Fabric mods I recommend also getting [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to keep an overview over all installed mods.

> **Note:** This mod is client-side only, meaning it does not have to be installed on the server.

## Usage

Press 'P' to toggle automatic walking. You can also hit the sprint key to sprint while auto-walking.

Press 'Mouse 5' for an alternate sprint key.

These keybinds can be customized in the controls options.
